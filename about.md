Hey you! I'm Yavelemira. I spend most of my time reading very old books, reading techy stuffs, working out, chilling, thinking about things, designing housies and loving my buba.

I'm also pretty smart, and I work as Information & Data Architect in a huge-ass company. I do all sorts of complicated stuffs that most people don't understand why they exist and why someone needs to do them in the first place, but believe me, they're super important thingies.

I come from a very lovely place that is famous for having beautiful girlies, and I'll admit that I am quite a hottie myself. My buba can verify that if you want to.

I like dogs, but in their absence, cats are also cute. In fact, I use almost exclusively cat stickers on telegram (ofc telegram is the best chat app - change my mind).

When I'm sad I tend to get an itsy bitsy pensive, but on the upside I get over it pretty fast. I'm what they call a rising phoenix. Sometimes I rise more like a penguin though.

I hope no-one gets to read these before I see them and fix, since I gave my buba access to the github repo where I host this website, and he's wreaking havoc everywhere âœ¨ðŸ’•.
