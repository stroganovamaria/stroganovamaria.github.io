Hey you! I'm Yavelemira. I spend most of my time reading very old books, reading techy stuffs, working out, chilling, thinking about things and designing houses.

I work as Information & Data Architect in an global health & hygiene company. I do all sorts of things that people don't understand why they exist and why someone needs to do them in the first place, but believe me, they're super important.

I like dogs, but in their absence, cats are also cute. In fact, I use almost exclusively cat stickers on telegram (ofc telegram is the best chat app - change my mind).
